"""What the site publishes for machines: a share card, and `llms.txt`.

Both are claims made somewhere nobody re-reads. A share preview is only ever seen
outside the repository, and `llms.txt` is read by a model that will not notice it is
describing a page that moved — which is the same shape as every stale number this
project has already had to fix, one hop further away from anyone who would spot it.

So: every URL a crawler is handed has to resolve to a file that exists, the image has
to be the size it declares, and the generated file has to be the one the generator
produces. `test_docs_consistency.py` runs the generator's own `--check`; this covers
the half that lives in HTML.
